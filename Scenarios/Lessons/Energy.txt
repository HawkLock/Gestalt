Lesson: Collision and Energy

[Explanation]
When objects collide, their energy and momentum change based on the type of collision. There are two main types of collisions:

- Elastic Collisions: Both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. Objects bounce off each other without losing energy.
- Inelastic Collisions: Momentum is conserved, but some kinetic energy is lost as heat, sound, or deformation.
- Perfectly Inelastic Collisions: The objects stick together after the collision, losing the most kinetic energy possible while still conserving momentum.

The relationship between the velocities before and after the collision is determined by the conservation laws:

Momentum Conservation:
m1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = m1 * v1' + m2 * v2'

Kinetic Energy Conservation (Elastic Collisions only):
(1/2) * m1 * v1^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2^2 = (1/2) * m1 * v1'^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2'^2

The coefficient of restitution (e) determines how "bouncy" a collision is:
- e = 1 for elastic collisions
- 0 < e < 1 for inelastic collisions
- e = 0 for perfectly inelastic collisions

[Scenario]
Two cubes with different masses and velocities are set up to collide.

- Sphere A: Mass = 20 kg, Initial Velocity = 3 m/s (right)
- Sphere B: Mass = 10 kg, Initial Velocity = -2 m/s (left)
- Coefficient of Restitution: 0.8 (partially elastic collision)

Run the simulation to observe:
- How their velocities change after impact.
- How kinetic energy is distributed before and after collision.
- The effect of changing the coefficient of restitution.

Try modifying the coefficient of restitution to 1 (elastic) or 0 (perfectly inelastic) to see different behaviors.
