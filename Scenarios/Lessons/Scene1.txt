Lesson: Kinematics

[Explanation]
Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it.
It involves key concepts such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

Displacement (Δx) is the change in position of an object.
Velocity (v) is the rate of change of displacement with time.
Acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity with time.

The kinematic equations for constant acceleration are:
1. v = v0 + at
2. x = x0 + v0t + (1/2)at^2
3. v^2 = v0^2 + 2aΔx

These equations predict how an object moves based on initial conditions.

[Scenario]
A ball is dropped from 10 meters. The simulation tracks:
- Displacement over time
- Velocity increasing due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²)
- A graph of velocity vs. time
- Simulated vs. calculated fall time (t = sqrt(2h/g))
