Lesson: Projectile Motion  

[Explanation]  
Projectile motion describes the motion of an object moving through the air under the influence of gravity after being launched. The motion can be analyzed as two independent components:  

- Horizontal Motion: The object moves with a constant velocity because there is no horizontal acceleration (ignoring air resistance).  
- Vertical Motion: The object accelerates downward due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²).  

The key equations governing projectile motion are:  

- Horizontal displacement:  
  x = v0 * cos(θ) * t  
- Vertical displacement:  
  y = v0 * sin(θ) * t - (1/2) * g * t^2  
- Time of flight (for a projectile launched and landing at the same height):  
  t = (2 * v0 * sin(θ)) / g  
- Maximum height:  
  h = (v0^2 * sin^2(θ)) / (2 * g)  
- Range (horizontal distance traveled before landing):  
  R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g  

These equations show that the angle and initial velocity affect how far and high the projectile will go.  

[Scenario]  
A cannon fires a projectile at an angle with a given velocity.  

- Initial Speed: 25 m/s  
- Launch Angle: 45°  
- Gravity: 9.81 m/s²  

Run the simulation to observe:  
- The projectile’s trajectory.  
- The maximum height reached.  
- The total time the projectile stays in the air.  
- The horizontal distance (range) the projectile travels.  

Try modifying the launch angle and initial velocity to see how they affect the projectile's motion. Experiment with angles like 30°, 60°, and 90° to compare the results.
